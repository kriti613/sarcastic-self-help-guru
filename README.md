# üß† Sarcastic Self-Help Guru ü§ñüí¨  
> "Therapy is expensive, my sarcasm is free."

A playful, sassy chatbot that roasts you while giving life advice. Built with Streamlit and Gemini API (Google AI), this app delivers hilarious, sarcastic, yet oddly insightful responses ‚Äî with emojis, animations, sample prompts, and a sprinkle of attitude.


## üöÄ About the Project

We all love a good self-help tip‚Ä¶ but let‚Äôs be honest, sometimes you just want someone to roast you while they motivate you.  
The idea behind this project was to build a chatbot that serves life advice with a bucketful of sarcasm, emojis, and attitude.  
It's like therapy, except sassier and way cheaper.

The chatbot is alive with animations, emojis, and clever banter. Whether you're asking, *"Why am I always broke?"* or *"Is my crush into me?"*, you'll get roasted, entertained, and (maybe) slightly enlightened.
