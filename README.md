# 🧠 Sarcastic Self-Help Guru 🤖💬  
> "Therapy is expensive, my sarcasm is free."

A playful, sassy chatbot that roasts you while giving life advice. Built with Streamlit and Gemini API (Google AI), this app delivers hilarious, sarcastic, yet oddly insightful responses — with emojis, animations, sample prompts, and a sprinkle of attitude.


## 🚀 About the Project

We all love a good self-help tip… but let’s be honest, sometimes you just want someone to roast you while they motivate you.  
The idea behind this project was to build a chatbot that serves life advice with a bucketful of sarcasm, emojis, and attitude.  
It's like therapy, except sassier and way cheaper.

The chatbot is alive with animations, emojis, and clever banter. Whether you're asking, *"Why am I always broke?"* or *"Is my crush into me?"*, you'll get roasted, entertained, and (maybe) slightly enlightened.
